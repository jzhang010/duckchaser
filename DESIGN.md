# Computer Vision in Robotics - Design Document
## Project Organization
The project struture borrows heavily from the FTC robotics library for the robot project structure in order to code the different robot components, and all of our original code can be found by going to duckchaser/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode. The teamcode is organized into two different folders, operation and subsystems. The operation folders contains all of the programs that are run 

## Subsystems 
### EyeOpenCV and EyePipeline 
The classes uses computer 

### Drivetrain

### Waver
We wanted to add a waver subsystem just as a physical way to see. The Waver class is very simple designed. 

## Operations
### Human Drive to Duck 
This was a relatively simple program to write
